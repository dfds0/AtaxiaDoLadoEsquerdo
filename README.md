# AtaxiaDoLadoEsquerdo

The premise of a 'Stand':
- In Object-oriented programming, you create a software using real object as reference
- This means that entity and code build with this paradigm will have the same behavior, restriction, and power of the real object
- Implicitly, this also means that his creative capacity has the same limits as his 'world'
- A Stand is a superior version of a real entity, an entity out of know world

FAQ:

 - Q: Is a Stand a 'workaround'  to violate the OOP?
 - A: It can be, but I don't care. 

 - Q: Is a Stand a reference to JOJO?
 - A: Yes

What is AtaxiaDoLadoEsquerdo (Ataxia Do Lado Esquerdo):
 - Is an application that read Grails/Groovy code, creates DataStatement.
 - With the Statements, a algorithm will be executed to evaluate what part of code needs tests and create the test for the code selected
 
Condition to change the code:
 - Except by the name of Stands (and your objective) and the name of solution (Ataxia Do Lado Esquerdo) you can change any code that you needs.

Condition to use:
 - Free for use
 
What this solution is able to do?
 - The solution is able to read a great variation of code in Groovy with framework Grails
 - Create 'Statements' related with the code read to be used in meta-programing
 - Create test using the Statements as reference

What this solution is not able to do? 
 - Evaluate the quality of your application
 - Read code in other language and create 'Statements'
 - Read 100% of an application in Groovy/Java

Recommendation:
- Check if the test created is useful for your application
- Create new 'test writer' for your application
- Use the statements to check the 'custom' patterns is not used
